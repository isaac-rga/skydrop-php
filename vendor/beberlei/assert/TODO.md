# TODO

- Upgrade assertions to return true on successful assertion to allow this library to be used with PHP7's assert() functionality.
- Refactor unit tests into sets of related assertions.
- Refactor all unit tests to use the new recommend exception testing pattern as the current `setExpectedException()` method is deprecated.
